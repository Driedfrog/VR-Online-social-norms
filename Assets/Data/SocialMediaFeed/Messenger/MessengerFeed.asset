  - message: With Batshuayi joining on loan this week, we surely now have - man for
      man - our best ever starting 11?

  - message: We even have a competent goalkeeper!

  - message: I'm sure top six fans will pick holes, but for a club of our size it's
      hard to imagine us ever being stronger than that. We may even see Benteke alongside
      Batshuayi in some games. If they're on form what a strike force that would be
      for a club in the bottom half.

  - message: I've always worried about how we'd cope if we lost Zaha, but if we could
      replace him with Batshuayi + one other decent winger I think we'd win
